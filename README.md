## Overview
Outbound Gear Exchange started as a collective of people who love the outdoors and wanted a space to be able to swap gear to take on new adventures and test out new gear setups. 

## Description
This application was designed to make outdoor activities more accessible by providing access to outdoor gear in your area. In this application, you can request gear or list gear available to swap including backpacking equipment, winter sports gear, and camping/hiking gear. You can use the site to view your cache of personal gear on the site and you can also search for gear by activity to explore the full OBE collection. Future development includes a possible marketplace for a commerce-based exchange, a bulletin board listing gear for sale or sought-after gear, and integration with local hiking apps like the WA Trail Association to connect gear with actual local trails.
